### About Me
My name is Rafae Khurram and I am from Pakistan. I recently turned 20 on the 13th of September. I have lived in London, Ontario since I was 6.  After highschool, I attended Western for 2 years, but really disliked university and the programs I was studying. Now I am attending Fanshawe in what would have been my 3rd year of university. I joined Interactive Media Design as it teaches in demand skills, which I hope to leverage in my career. My dream is to pursue content creation and become a full-time Youtuber. I primarily make gaming videos, but have dabbled in other genres too. Below will be a link to my youtube channel!
